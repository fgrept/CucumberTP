Forked from https://github.com/johnstinson99/-Java-TDD-BDD-Coding-Kata---Exercise
Template for Roman Numerals TDD coding exercise with Maven

This repository contains all you need to get started with the Roman Numerals Kata in Maven.
The exercise is to convert numbers to Roman Numerals.  

All libraries and initial example JUnit and Cucumber tests are already present.
Add the next simplest unit test, then implement the simplest code to allow it to pass.  
Once the test is passing, look for opportunities to refactor, then repeat.
